Hello everyone! This python script uses the selenium library and a web driver for CHROME to webscrape.
For this to work, please follow the steps below:

1. Install selenium through your terminal.
This can be done by typing

pip install selenium

into your terminal. If this doesn't work try

pip3 install selenium

2. Although this includes a chromedriver, it might not be compatible with your version of Google Chrome. 
Check your version of google chrome by clicking the 3 dots at the top-right of your browser. 
Hover over 'Help' and click 'About Google Chrome'. You would be redirected to a page about your chrome version, if its 85, use the one I provided.
Otherwise, get chromedriver here:

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

then, delete my provided chromedriver and replace it with the one applicable for your version.

Thank you.
